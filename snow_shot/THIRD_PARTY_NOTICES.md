# Snow Shot Third-Party Notices

Snow Shot incorporates third-party software and assets under their respective
licenses. The release build generates a complete, versioned notice bundle from
the resolved Rust dependency graph, installed vcpkg packages, the audited
static Qt build, and repository-owned attribution files.

Installed releases place that bundle under:

```text
share/snow-shot/licenses/third-party/
```

`INDEX.md` in that directory records every collected package and source
license file. The bundle includes the Ant Design Icons MIT notice from
`ant_design_qt/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

Screen color restoration uses nalgebra (Apache-2.0) for fixed-size matrix
inversion and validation. Its license and resolved dependencies are included
in the generated Rust dependency notice bundle.

The OCR worker uses `ort` and `ort-sys` 2.0.0-rc.13 (MIT OR Apache-2.0), pinned to
revision `90018ee581fb1bb1baf8e82eba8e679728ff27dc` of
https://github.com/mg-chao/ort with a native diagnostic-decoding and logger-category
fix. Cargo retrieves their source and original license files from that fork.
The release collector includes the selected Rust FFI and static OCR-worker
dependency graphs, including these Git dependencies.

Windows releases currently redistribute the immutable OCR runtime 1.0.8 from
the pinned asset manifest. Its license collection retains RapidOCR's original
CLI, encoded-image, HTTP/TLS, model-download, and YAML dependency closure even
when the locally built raw-pixel worker omits those features. This collection
must follow the published runtime until its versioned payload is replaced.

The GPL-3.0-only `snow-shot-updater` sidecar is implemented in Rust and is
distributed as part of Snow Shot. Its resolved normal and build dependency
graph—including Tokio, Reqwest with native platform TLS, Serde, RSA/SHA-256,
SemVer, ZIP/Deflate, and Microsoft windows-rs—is collected into the same
versioned notice bundle from its independently locked Cargo package.

The optional PP-OCRv4 and PP-OCRv5 detector/recognizer models and dictionaries
are redistributed from RapidAI/RapidOCR's ModelScope release `v3.9.2`, whose
model card declares Apache License 2.0:
https://www.modelscope.cn/models/RapidAI/RapidOCR/files?Revision=v3.9.2.
Snow Shot downloads the matching mobile/server bundles from
https://www.modelscope.cn/models/mgchao/SnowShotOCR and pins their sizes and
SHA-256 hashes in `packaging/snow-shot-ocr-asset-manifest.json`.

Local crash diagnostics on Windows and macOS use Crashpad (Apache-2.0), pinned by the vcpkg baseline
and the repository's Crashpad overlay. The client, helper, Chromium base code,
and their bundled notices are included in the vcpkg license collection. The
Qt-independent OCR bridge and shared Rust panic hook are Apache-2.0 code under
`snow-crates/`.

In-process barcode recognition and Smart Erase reconstruction use OpenCV
(Apache-2.0), pinned by the vcpkg
baseline and built as static libraries with only the `wechat_qrcode` (contrib)
and `barcode` (objdetect) module closure; the dnn module embeds OpenCV's
bundled protobuf (BSD-3-Clause). Both licenses are included in the vcpkg
license collection. Smart Erase uses the existing `core` and `imgproc` modules
for deterministic multiscale patch reconstruction; it adds no model downloads or
additional OpenCV modules. The WeChat QR detection and super-resolution models are
redistributed from https://github.com/WeChatCV/opencv_3rdparty at revision
`a8b69ccc738421293254aec5ddb38bd523503252`, pinned by SHA-512 in
`cmake/FetchSnowShotQrModels.cmake`.

Selected-text acquisition and its C bridge (`snow-selected-text` and
`snow-selected-text-c`) are Apache-2.0 code under `snow-crates/`. They use the
existing Microsoft windows-rs dependency (MIT OR Apache-2.0) for Windows UI
Automation, native edit controls, and clipboard interoperability. On macOS they
use accessibility-sys (MIT OR Apache-2.0), core-foundation (MIT OR Apache-2.0),
and the existing objc2 framework bindings (Zlib OR Apache-2.0 OR MIT) for
Accessibility and pasteboard interoperability. Their resolved notices are
included in the generated Rust dependency bundle. Apple system frameworks are
provided by macOS and are not redistributed.
Full includes these components in its unified Rust FFI archive; Mini's archive
does not enable the selected-text dependency.

macOS application QoS uses the repository's Apache-2.0 `snow-core` scheduling
policy and the existing Rayon worker pools (MIT OR Apache-2.0). Native pthread
and dispatch APIs are provided by macOS and are not redistributed. The resolved
Rayon notices remain included in the generated Rust dependency bundle.

Smart selection (`snow-ui-selector` and `snow-ui-selector-c`) uses the same
accessibility-sys, core-foundation, and core-foundation-sys dependencies
(MIT OR Apache-2.0) for macOS Accessibility and Quartz window snapshots.
ApplicationServices, CoreFoundation, and CoreGraphics are system frameworks and
are not redistributed. Windows selection continues to use Microsoft windows-rs.

Mouse and keyboard effect rendering and its C bridge (`snow-recording-effects`
and `snow-recording-effects-c`) are Apache-2.0 code under `snow-crates/`. They
reuse crossbeam-channel (MIT OR Apache-2.0) and Microsoft windows-rs (MIT OR
Apache-2.0) for bounded input observation and native font rendering. Their
resolved licenses are included in the generated Rust dependency bundle.

Shared recording source metadata and export settings reuse bincode 1.3.3 (MIT)
for versioned serialization. Its original notice is included in the resolved
Rust dependency bundle. Deferred HDR source encoding uses the existing x265
(GPL-2.0-or-later) dependency with both 8-bit and Main10 APIs; it adds no separate
codec library or license.

GPU screen recording uses the repository's Apache-2.0 `snow-d3d11` crate and
Microsoft windows-rs (MIT OR Apache-2.0). The restricted FFmpeg 9.0 build enables
native H.264 surfaces using AMD AMF headers 1.5.2 (MIT), NVIDIA nv-codec-headers
13.0.19.0 (MIT), and Intel oneVPL dispatcher 2.17.0 (MIT). The headers and
dispatcher notices are collected from the resolved vcpkg packages, including
the full copyright notices. Vendor display drivers supply the hardware codec
implementations; those drivers are not distributed with Snow Shot.

The standalone macOS media libraries use objc2 framework bindings, block2,
and dispatch2 (MIT), and CoreText/CoreGraphics system font rendering. Apple's
ScreenCaptureKit, CoreVideo, Metal, CoreAudio, and VideoToolbox frameworks are
provided by macOS and are not redistributed. The macOS FFmpeg profile includes
x264 (GPL-2.0-or-later), x265 (GPL-2.0-or-later), WebP (BSD-3-Clause), and zlib-ng
(Zlib). The resulting FFmpeg binaries are GPL builds. Capture-only C libraries
do not link FFmpeg. Each architecture's resolved license bundle is generated
with `scripts/collect-third-party-licenses.ps1 -StandaloneMedia`.

Recording GIF regression tests use the `gif` crate 0.14.2 (MIT OR Apache-2.0)
as an independent decoder. It is a development dependency; the adaptive palette
encoder adds no production dependencies. The crate's original notices are in
the Cargo registry source used by the test build.

The generated bundle is authoritative for a particular binary because its
contents are produced from that build environment. Dependency licenses and
copyright notices remain the property of their respective owners.

The optional `snow-shot-mcp` stdio bridge uses the `rmcp` Rust SDK (Apache-2.0)
and its macro/schema dependencies, plus `interprocess` (0BSD OR Apache-2.0)
for same-user local sockets. The complete resolved dependency and license
closure is collected from `snow_shot/rust/snow-shot-mcp/Cargo.lock` by the
standard license collection script.

## STranslate OCR Layout Analysis

The Smart Merge implementation in `src/presentation/ocr/screenshotocrlayout.cpp`
and its layout test fixtures are adapted from STranslate's `OcrLayoutAnalyzer.cs`
and `OcrLayoutAnalyzerTests.cs` (https://github.com/STranslate/STranslate).
Snow Shot adapts the algorithm to Qt and retains unsupported OCR geometry as
original translation units. The following license applies to the adapted code:

Auto Filter uses the repository's Apache-2.0 `visual-region-detector` and
`snow-visual-region-detector-c` crates with the pure Rust backend. Its image
boundary uses the existing `image` dependency (MIT OR Apache-2.0); JPEG support
adds `zune-core` and `zune-jpeg` (MIT OR Apache-2.0 OR Zlib). Their resolved
licenses are included in the Rust dependency notice bundle. OpenCV is not
required by this feature.


## Snow Shot MCP executable

`snow-shot-mcp` is GPL-3.0-only application code. It uses the official Rust MCP SDK
(`rmcp`, Apache-2.0) and same-user local IPC (`interprocess`, 0BSD OR Apache-2.0).
The following resolved normal/build dependencies are included in the Windows bridge;
platform-specific dependencies for macOS are selected by Cargo for the target architecture.
The packaging license collector includes each package's original license and notice files.
