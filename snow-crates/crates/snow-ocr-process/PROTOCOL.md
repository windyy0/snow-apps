# OCR protocol 4

Runtime 1.0.8 uses a binary stdin/stdout command channel. Diagnostics use stderr.
The application and runtime are released together; earlier protocols are incompatible.
All integers and IEEE-754 floats are little-endian. A string is a `u32` byte
length followed by UTF-8. Frames have a 20-byte header: `SOCR`, version `u16`,
kind `u16`, operation ID `u64`, payload size `u32`. Payloads are capped at 1 MiB.

| Kind | Name | Operation ID | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Hello | 0 | Writable capability-cache directory string |
| 2 | Ready | 0 | Success `u8`, capability `u8` (0), provider string (`unloaded`), runtime version string, protocol `u32` |
| 3 | Submit image | Recognition token | Mapping generation `u64`, width/height/stride `u32`, transfer sequence `u64` |
| 4 | Cancel | Recognition token | Empty |
| 5 | Complete | Recognition token | Recognition result, described below |
| 6 | Shutdown | 0 | Empty |
| 7 | ShutdownAck | 0 | Empty |
| 8 | PrepareSession | Session operation | DirectML requested `u8`, detector resize policy `u8` (0 = max, 1 = min), detector/recognizer/dictionary path strings |
| 9 | SessionReady | Session operation | Success `u8` |
| 10 | ReleaseSession | Session operation | Empty |
| 11 | SessionReleased | Session operation | Empty |
| 12 | AttachBuffer | Mapping generation | File path string, total mapped bytes `u64` |
| 13 | BufferAttached | Mapping generation | Empty |
| 14 | Recognize | Recognition token | Empty |
| 15 | ImageConsumed | Recognition token | Mapping generation `u64`, transfer sequence `u64` |
| 16 | DetachBuffer | Mapping generation | Empty |
| 17 | BufferDetached | Mapping generation | Empty |
| 18 | DiscardImage | Recognition token | Empty |

`Ready` establishes only the command channel. It does not open an image buffer,
probe a model, or create an inference session. Model creation and inference run
on one executor thread, which owns the session exclusively. The command thread
can copy the next image during inference. There is at most one active inference
and one staged, child-owned image. `Recognize` consumes that staged image using
the currently acknowledged session. The parent decides dispatch order and when
an idle cycle begins; an empty child command queue alone is not an idle signal.

Session replacement drops the previous engine before creating the next one.
Idle hot start is `ReleaseSession`, acknowledgement, then `PrepareSession` for
the latest configuration. Session preparation accepts no image. DirectML
initialization/inference retains the capability cache and CPU fallback policy.
A failed session preparation leaves no usable session and does not exit the
process. Only real recognition requests receive user-facing errors.

An image mapping contains one 32-byte slot header followed by tightly packed
RGBA pixels. Header offsets are sequence `u64` at 0; state `u32` at 8; width,
height, stride, byte count, and magic `u32` at 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Ready state
is 1 and magic is `0x544f4c53`. The parent publishes pixels before marking the
slot ready. Dimensions must be positive, total pixels must not exceed
`3840 * 2160`, and stride must equal `width * 4`.

`ImageConsumed` proves the child has copied the pixels and no longer reads that
slot. The parent may then reuse its capacity. To resize or delete the mapping,
it sends `DetachBuffer` and waits for `BufferDetached`, which proves the child
has dropped its mapping. Only then may the parent unmap/delete the file. A new
mapping receives a new generation, with transfer sequences increasing from 1.
There is no mapping during warm-up or process-only startup.

Cancellation sets only the corresponding active inference's flag; an ONNX call
already executing may finish. `DiscardImage` removes a canceled staged image.
The parent suppresses canceled callbacks and waits for physical inference to
drain before releasing its session. Default-mode final-request cancellation may
still terminate the child; resident-mode cancellation never does.

`Complete` starts with status `u8`: 0 failure plus error string; 2 cancellation
plus message string; or 1 success plus reserved string, line count `u32`, then
each line's text string, confidence `f32`, and eight quad-coordinate `f32`s.
The parent preserves callback submission order even when local image rendering
finishes later. It validates process generation, session operation, mapping
generation, and image sequence before applying acknowledgements.
